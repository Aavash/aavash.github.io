                <p>I have been working professionally as a software developer since 2018.
                    In these 5 years, I've worked with multiple tech stacks and programming languages. When it comes to
                    programming languages, I have mainly worked with python, javascript and golang.</p>
                <p>While I've assumed role as Android developer, Full stack Developer and
                    Devops Engineer, I found myself to have more aptitude towards Backend and Devops aspect of software
                    engineering. Thus, I am working as Backend Engineer with Devops responisilities since more than 3
                    years.</p>
                <p>My roles requires me to work mainly with python and golang for backend
                    and cloud platforms like GCP and AWS mainly. Requirement gathering, sprint planning, development,
                    writing unit tests and deploying applications are some of my day to day responisilities.</p>
                <p>I am passionate about devops and realize its importance in the software
                    engineering life cycle. I enjoy learning newer technologies and have experience researching and
                    implementing services for organizations I've worked with in the past. Having worked with large
                    monolithic applications to microservice based applications, I've containerized and deployed apps
                    with orchestration tools like kubernetes and docker swarm. Also I've used cloud services like AWS
                    EC2, AWS lambda, AWS fargate, GCP compute, AWS RDS, GCP App engine, GCP Cloud Run, GCP SQL and many
                    others.</p>
                <p>I'd love to know more about you and I am sure that I can add value to
                    your goals. Feel free to connect with me I to know more about me.</p>
