            of sitting infront of PC all the time, this has been a refreshing change for me.

               I am a huge open source and linux fanboy.I have contributed to some of the open source project. I am very grateful for 
               all the resources that were available for free to help me learn and develop softwares with. This has been the driving factor for
               me to support the open source community. In my spare time, I experiment with linux distros and other free open source softwares. 
               Also I've recently taught myself play guitar but I'm not very good at it!!!!!!!
